* HFD protocol on exposure per parity

* Back of the envelope calculation accounting for parity

$$\sum_x P_x \cdot M_x \cdot (\sum^5_j p_j\cdot j)$$

* Define potential project on NSFG data

    * 2006-2019 NSFG data
    
    * Race, Age (in 5 years?)
    
    * Geography?
    
    * Metrics of interest: childlessness at end of reproduction, variance in probability of childless
    
    * Modeling opportunity? (ie Multinomial with parametric forms on the ps)


* Modeling: multinomial with model on ps, over time, by age, sex (and geographical location) + focus on childlessness
